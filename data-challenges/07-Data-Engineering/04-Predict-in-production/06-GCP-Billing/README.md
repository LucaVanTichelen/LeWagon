## Objective

Use **Billing** in order to monitor your expenses in the Google Cloud Platform.

## Create a budget alert

All GCP services are paying, and remember that you entered your credit card in GCP on setup day.

Let's create an expense alert and keep an eye on your budget ðŸ’¸

Creating a budget alert will allow you to be notified when your expense thresholds are reached.

It will allow you to fine tune your usage of the Google Cloud Platform.

Open the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)...

Go to Billing / Budgets & alerts
- CREATE BUDGET

or [follow the guide](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets#add-new-budget).

And create an alert that suits your needs.

## Follow and analyse your expenses

Go to the [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) section in the GCP console.

Open your billing account.

**Overview** displays a forecast of the costs for the current month per project and per product.

In order to have a look at the expenses of the current month:
- Select **Reports**
- By default the *Usage date* covers the *Current month*, which is fine
- You can opt to **Group by Service** in order to see the costs for your projects per product
- On the right, unselect **Discounts** and **Promotions and others** in order to show the costs that are otherwise hidden as long as they are covered by the $300 of the free trial
- You will have an overview of the costs of all products on all of your projects
- You may single out a product and/or a project in order to dig into the expenses

Once your free trial is over, you will be able to dig through the actual expenses in the monthly invoices.

In order to dig through a monthly invoice:
- Select **Cost table**
- Select an invoice month
- Dig through the projects and products

In order to compare the costs vs the discounts and promotions:
- Select **Cost breakdown**
- Select an invoice month
