A quicker way to leverage cloud computing capabilities is to make use of **cloud-based notebooks-as-a-service**, which are often free for prototyping use.

This challenge shows you how to train a deep-learning version of TaxiFare model using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) GPUs!

Google Colab provides about 10 hours of CPU & GPU uptime, after which the online notebook kernel shuts down and you'll need to manually restart it. That is usually sufficient for _prototyping_ even the largest Deep Learning challenges you may encounter.

üëâ Open the following github [repository](https://github.com/lewagon/taxi-fare-deep) and follow instructions to try it out yourself.

üèÅ (Optional): When you are done read these [10 tips for a better colab experience](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-tips-for-a-better-google-colab-experience-33f8fe721b82) to make the most out of Google Collab. It may prove useful during your project weeks.
