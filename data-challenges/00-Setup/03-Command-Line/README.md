Being proficient with the command line is something that will prove useful in your entire career.

One very good book we recommend is [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/) by [Michael Hartl](https://twitter.com/mhartl) (RailsTutorial.org creator).

If you've reached this challenge, it means that you are done with the setup, with a laptop ready for weeks of intensive coding!

You can leave now, and enjoy the early evening as it will be pretty rare. If you feel like staying a bit, you can:

1. Help your buddy
1. Do your flashcards of the day
1. [Test](https://cmdchallenge.com/) your knowledge of the command-line

Thank you!
