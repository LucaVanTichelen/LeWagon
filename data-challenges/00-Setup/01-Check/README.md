Welcome to Kitt! The teacher will now demonstrate how to work on an exercise.

## What's this about?

The goal is to implement a function called `circle_area`, which takes **one** parameter,
`radius`, and returns the area of the circle of the given radius. As a reminder,
here is the formula:

Open the `demo.py` file and implement it!

There are **3 tests** that you can run with the `make` command from the terminal. Make sure the tests are all green before moving to the next challenge!

## Pushing to Kitt

When `make` is 'happy' and all green, do not forget to push to GitHub!

```bash
git add demo.py
git commit --message "Solved the first challenge of the bootcamp :)"
git push origin master
```

Shortly after your push is completed, [GitHub will tell Kitt](https://sebastien.saunier.me/blog/2014/04/21/practical-example-of-using-git-in-a-school.html) about this push thanks to a [webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/).

Kitt will then pull your code, run `make` and update your challenge status (completion + style score). You should also see how your buddy of the day is doing!
