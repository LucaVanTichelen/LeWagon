# Start your final project :rocket:

## Setup the project

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>I am the project leader</strong></summary>
Let's create a new project:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
packgenlite project_name
cd project_name
```

Then create a GitHub repository and push your project:

```bash
gh repo create
git push origin master
```

Finally, add your teammates as collaborators on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>I am a teammate</strong></summary>
Let's clone the project:

```bash
mkdir ~/code/<PROJECT_LEADER_GITHUB_NICKNAME> && cd "$_"
git clone git@github.com:<PROJECT_LEADER_GITHUB_NICKNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>.git
cd project_name
```

Then add a `raw_data` directory (as it is not tracked by `git`):

```bash
mkdir raw_data
```

You're good to go.

## Setup a new `virtualenv` (opt.)

First, we will create a virtual env for the project:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv project_name
```

Then, we need to tell pyenv that we want to use this virtual env for our project. In order to do that, let's go to the directory of the project:

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>I am the project leader</strong></summary>


```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/<PROJECT_NAME>
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>I am a teammate</strong></summary>


```bash
cd ~/code/<PROJECT_LEADER_GITHUB_NICKNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>
```
</details>

An run:

```bash
pyenv local project_name
```

This command creates a `.python-version` file in the directory of the project containing the name of the virtual env (`cat .python-version`). This is what allows pyenv to know which virtual env to use

ðŸ‘‰ You may store this file in `git`. If you do so, **make sure** that your teammates use the same name as you do for the virtual env of the project

ðŸ‘‰ From now on, all the commands that you run in the directory (or in any sub directory) of your project will be using the virtual env of your project

ðŸ‘‰ All the commands that you run outside of the directory of your project will continue to use your *global* virtual env (set as *lewagon* on setup day by the command `pyenv global lewagon`)

ðŸš¨ This applies in particular to jupyter notebooks: make sure that your are located inside of the directory of your project when running `jupyter notebook` if you want your code to run in the virtual env of your project

Using this setup, you can easily switch from the virtual env of a project to the one of another project... All you need to do in order to do so is to go in the directory of the project... Pretty handy ðŸ‘Œ

### Install minimal packages

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r https://gist.githubusercontent.com/krokrob/53ab953bbec16c96b9938fcaebf2b199/raw/9035bbf12922840905ef1fbbabc459dc565b79a3/minimal_requirements.txt
pip list
```

## Split the work

1. Brainstorm the objectives of the project with your team
2. Write 4-8 parallel jobs
3. Each teammate take one job and split it into small task

You can use Post-it, a [Trello](https://trello.com/) board, GitHub [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-project-board) or any other project management tool your want to drive your project tasks.
