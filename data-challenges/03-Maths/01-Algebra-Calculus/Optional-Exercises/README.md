## Optional Exercises
Congratulations! You have learned the basic mathematics tools we will use during the upcoming weeks.

If you are done with all the previous challenges, you can try these katas on Codewars:
- [Calculate the trace of a square matrix](https://www.codewars.com/kata/matrix-trace/train/python)
- [Write a function that accepts a square matrix (N x N 2D array) and returns the determinant of the matrix.](https://www.codewars.com/kata/matrix-determinant/train/python)

# Plot some beautiful graphs
Yesterday, we saw a lot of different techniques and libraries for Data Visualization. If you have finished all the exercises and completed the challenges from Codewars, go back to these exercises and try to finish them.
