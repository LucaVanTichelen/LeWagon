## Background

For this exercise, we will flip a coin (each flip has an equal chance of coming up heads or tails). This kind of experiment has no memory, in other words, "each flip is independent". Even though there is no way to predict what will be the next flip, if we flip a coin a number of times, the laws of probability allow us to predict the probability of obtaining various results. The accuracy will be greater as the number of flips increases.
