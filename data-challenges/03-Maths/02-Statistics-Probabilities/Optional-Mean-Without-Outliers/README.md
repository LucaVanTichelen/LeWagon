Congratulations on finishing all the challenges for the day!

Why don't you head over to the previous days from this week and complete them as well?

If you are 100% finished everywhere (including optionals), you can head over to the
following Codewars Kata:

:point_right: [Mean without Outliers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/mean-without-outliers/train/python)

In this Kata, you will implement a `clean_mean(sample, cutoff)` that will compute the mean of a `sample` _excluding_ outliers based on the given `cutoff`.
