## Central Limit Theorem

Last but not least, let's verify experimentally the Central Limit Theorem together.

In this exercise, we will use the "tips" dataset to randomly select dinners and add their associated tips one at a time.

We will see that as the number of selected dinners gets larger, the mean of all the tips converges towards a normal distribution of well known properties, that we can exploit to provide meaningful probabilistic conclusions.

To get started open the notebook in this exercise folder with `jupyter notebook`.
