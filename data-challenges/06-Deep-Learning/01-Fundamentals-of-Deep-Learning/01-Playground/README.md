# Playground

The first exercise is an gentle introduction to Deep Learning. Thanks to the Tensorflow playground, a site that emulates a neural network, you will get a better intuition of the operations that are going on in a neural network. It is also intended to give you a visual representation of neural networks that will ease your comprehension for the rest of the week.

Start the `playground.ipynb` notebook with `jupyter notebook`.

⚠️ If you are an **Apple M1** user, follow the next steps:

The TensorFlow library is not compatible yet with your system, so you need to open the `playground.ipynb` notebook and all the Deep Learning module notebooks on [Google Colab](https://research.google.com).

1. Upload the Jupyter notebook on Colab
2. Go to Google drive, you will see a newly-created folder called Colab Notebooks, don’t rename it !
3. Go to this folder and prefix your challenge’s filename by `DL1` for example, you don’t want your Colab Notebooks folder to be a mess
4. Right-click on this and Open with Colaboratory
5. Do the challenge
6. Click on File > Download `.ipynb`
7. Store it in your data-challenges folder and push it
