# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 2 - Playground Part II

The exercise uses the Tensorflow playground as a tool to visually check how different hyperparameters of neural networks impact the convergence of the algorithm.

This visualisation is intended to translate the neural network that what you define on the Playground to its writing with the Keras library
