### Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 4 - Predict air pollution

In this exercise, you will have sequence of weather features based on which you will predict the air pollution on the next day.

The exercise is also design to learn how to prepare data in real-life scenario where their are not in the right format. Moreover, you will see how to stack multiple RNN layers.
