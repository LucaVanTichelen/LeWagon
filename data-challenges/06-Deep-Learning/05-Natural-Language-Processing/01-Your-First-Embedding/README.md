# Keras Embedding

Let's start the day by doing some sentiment analysis.
You will be given IMDB reviews, which are movie reviews associated to a positive or negative feedback.

Thanks to the `Embedding` layer in Keras, you will be able to feed a Recurrent Neural Network with text!

## Requirement

Install [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets):

```bash
pip install tensorflow-datasets
```
