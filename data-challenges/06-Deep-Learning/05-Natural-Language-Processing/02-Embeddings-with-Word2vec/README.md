# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 5 - Understand embedding with Word2Vec


In this notebook, we will look at word2vec, a technique for word embedding.

The goal of word2vec is to provide a mapping from the dictionary of words present in a text to vectors of fixed dimension. The main motivation is that working on words directly is not possible.

This exercise will make you better understand the embeddings in general.

## Requirement

Install the [GENSIM](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) and the [python-Levenshtein](https://github.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein) libraries:

```bash
pip install gensim python-Levenshtein
```
