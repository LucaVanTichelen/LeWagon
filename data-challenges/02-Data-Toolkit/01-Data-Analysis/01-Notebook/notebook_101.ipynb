    "Welcome to your first notebook! If this is not your first time, please read along, you might learn a few tricks/shortcuts you don't know already!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is a document that contains both code (e.g. Python) and rich text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, links, etc. thanks to [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/))\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook combines three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **notebook web application**: An interactive web application for writing and running code interactively and authoring notebook documents.\n",
    "2. **Kernels**: Separate processes started by the notebook web application that runs users‚Äô code in a given language and returns the output back to the notebook web application. The kernel also handles things like computations for interactive widgets, tab completion and introspection.\n",
    "3. **Notebook documents**: Self-contained documents that contain a representation of all content visible in the notebook web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, narrative text, equations, images, and rich media representations of objects. Each notebook document has its own kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Through Jupyter‚Äôs kernel and messaging architecture, the Notebook allows code to be run in a range of different programming languages. For each notebook document that a user opens, the web application starts a kernel that runs the code for that notebook. Each kernel is capable of running code in a single programming language and there are kernels available in the following languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python](https://github.com/ipython/ipython)\n",
    "- [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)\n",
    "- [R](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel)\n",
    "- [Ruby](https://github.com/sciruby/iruby)\n",
    "\n",
    "The default kernel runs Python code. The notebook provides a simple way for users to pick which of these kernels is used for a given notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these kernels communicate with the notebook web application and web browser using a JSON over ZeroMQ/WebSockets message protocol that is described [here](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/messaging.html). Most users don‚Äôt need to know about these details, but it helps to understand that ‚Äúkernels run code.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't remember which Kernels are already installed on your laptop, open your terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "Notebook documents contain the inputs and outputs of an interactive session as well as narrative text that accompanies the code but is not meant for execution. Rich output generated by running code, including HTML, images, video, and plots, is embedded in the notebook, which makes it a complete and self-contained record of a computation.\n",

    "1. **Code** cells: Input and output of live code that is run in the kernel\n",
    "1. **Markdown** cells: Narrative text with embedded LaTeX equations\n",
    "1. **Raw cells**: Unformatted text that is included, without modification, when notebooks are converted to different formats using `nbconvert`\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, notebook documents are [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (try opening them in VS Code and see for yourself!). This allows them to be read and manipulated programmatically by any programming language. Because JSON is a text format, notebook documents are version control friendly.\n",
    "\n",
