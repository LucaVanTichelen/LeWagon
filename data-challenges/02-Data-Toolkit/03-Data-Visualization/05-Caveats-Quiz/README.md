# Caveats Quiz

In this exercise you will **test** your knowledge on the caveats around the plots we have seen so far.
The answers are either in the articles given in the two previous exercises or in these [articles](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html). üîç

Open your `quiz.py` and for each questions make the function return the right answers.
Make sure you run the test **only** when you have **filled every question**.

The expected return is **always** an **array** with the right answers.

Example:

```python
def one_plus_one_is():
    possible_answers = [
        0,
        1,
        2,
        -1
    ]

    return []
```

Answer

```python
def one_plus_one_is():
    possible_answers = [
        #0,
        1,
        #2,
        #-1
    ]

    return possible_answers
```
