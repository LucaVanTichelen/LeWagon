# Data Preprocessing

ðŸŽ¯ Today's challenges consist of preparing a dataset to ready it for modelling. You will:

- Deal with missing values
- Hunt down outliers
- Scale the features
- Encode features
- Engineer new features

You will then perform feature selection using two different techniques:

- Collinearity filtering
- Feature Permutation

Happy cleaning! ðŸš€
