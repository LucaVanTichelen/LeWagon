# Loss Functions

The exercise consists of investigating the effects of loss functions on the performance of Linear Regression models. The investigation is done through the following task:

🎯 You must predict the average temperature inside a greenhouse based on its design. Your temperature predictions will help you select the appropriate greenhouse design for each plant, based on their climatic needs.

🌿 You know that plants can handle small temperature variations, but are exponentially more sensitive as the temperature variations increase.

❓ Which loss function do you train your model on?

To start the exercise, open `Loss-Functions.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

🚀 Your turn!
