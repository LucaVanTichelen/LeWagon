# Gradient Descent

This exercise consists of coding a Gradient Descent by hand! 💪

You will be creating functions for each of the following steps of a Gradient Descent epoch:

1. Hypothesis Function ❓
2. Loss function
3. Gradient computation
4. Step sizes 👣
5. Parameter update

You will then combine your functions into a single one, and do some visualization.

To start the exercise, open `Gradient-Descent.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

🚀 Your turn!
