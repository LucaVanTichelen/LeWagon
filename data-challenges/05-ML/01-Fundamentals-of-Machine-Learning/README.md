# Machine Learning Fundamentals

In today's challenges, you will:

- Familiarize yourself with Scikit-Learn and its modelling workflow
- Model a regression task with the Linear Regression algorithm
- Model a classification task with the Logistic Regression algorithm
- Use K-Fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance
- Plot the Learning Curves of models to diagnose Bias, Variance, and necessary training size
- Use your models to make predictions!

Have fun ðŸš€
