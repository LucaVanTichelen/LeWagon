# Logistic Regression

Up until now, you have been modelling a regression task. This time around, you will be modelling a **classification task** on the famous Titanic dataset.

## Download the dataset

The dataset is available [here](https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Machine%20Learning%20Datasets/ML_Titanic_dataset.csv). Let's download it and store it in the `data` folder in the `01-Fundamentals-of-Machine-Learning` directory with the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/data-challenges/05-ML/01-Fundamentals-of-Machine-Learning
curl https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Machine%20Learning%20Datasets/ML_Titanic_dataset.csv > data/titanic.csv
cd 04-Logistic-Regression
```

## Let's go

To start the exercise, open `Logistic_Regression.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

ðŸš€ Your turn!
