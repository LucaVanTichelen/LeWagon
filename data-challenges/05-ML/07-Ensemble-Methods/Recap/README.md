In this recap, the teacher will:
1. First, read through the solution notebook `houses_kaggle_competition_solution.ipynb` together
2. Show you a packaged version of the challenge `houses_trainer_package`

You will be able to download both of them from Kitt after the recap. Keep them as reference for a clean template of data-science project in the future!
