# Recap

## The dataset

The dataset is available [here](https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Machine%20Learning%20Datasets/ML_spotify_data.csv)). Let's download it and store it in the `data` folder in the `Recap` directory with the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/data-challenges/05-ML/03-Performance-metrics/Recap
curl https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Machine%20Learning%20Datasets/ML_spotify_data.csv > data/spotify_data.csv
```

## The task

In this Recap, you are going to use a K-Nearest-Neighbors model to find data observations that are similar to one another, or complete opposites.

You will then get a first glimpse at the effects of data scaling on Machine learning modelling.

To start the recap, open `Recap.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook`.
