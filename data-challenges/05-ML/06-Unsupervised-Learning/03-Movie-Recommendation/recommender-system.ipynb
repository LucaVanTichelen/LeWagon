    "Recommender systems are useful for recommending users items based on their past preferences. Recommender systems are generally classified into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content-based** based on similarity of item attributes (e.g. keywords, categories) and users preferences: For instance, if a user liked Item A, the recommender system would recommend items with similar characteristics. If we would talk about movies, those characteristics would include producer, genre, etc... Typically, this can be done with a binary classification supervised algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaborative filtering**, which calculates similarity from interactions (e.g. ratings, number of purchases, likes, etc.). This process finds customers who have similar preferences, and then gives recommendations to one customer from a set of items that are new to that particular customer and preferred by other customers with a similar profile. The system makes an assumption that users with similar movie watching habits have similar preferences in general. It finds users who watch videos similar to those the user watches, then identifies videos those similar users have watched, but which the first user has not. There are 3 approaches to this; user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- New approaches and usually more powerful are **Hybrid systems**, which combine the two aforementioned methods.\n",
