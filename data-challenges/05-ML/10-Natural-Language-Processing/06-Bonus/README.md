## Bonus

NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer performs better when itknows the function of a word within the text. One way to do so is through the use of POS tags.

Your task is to create a function that lemmatizes your text while taking into account the associated POS tags. 

To start the exercise, open `05-POS-Lemma.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
