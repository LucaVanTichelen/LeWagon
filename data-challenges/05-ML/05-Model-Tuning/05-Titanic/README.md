Using what you have learnt this week, try to build a model to classify surviving passenger of the Titanic, and challenge your buddy one a real test score, without making any data-leakage.


To start the exercise, open `titanic_classifier.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

ðŸš€ Your turn!
