## Background & Objectives

The goal of this challenge is to explore a [SQLite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) database to understand its schema.

## Tool

Download and install [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), a free and open source powerful tool to connect to any database, explore the schema and even **run SQL queries**.

## Specs

### Database schema

Open DBeaver and connect to the `data/movies.sqlite` database. Then explore the different tables to answer the following questions:

- What are the tables and the relationships between tables?
- What are the columns and their types?

Use [db.lewagon.com](http://db.lewagon.com/) to draw this movies database schema.
To check your solution, click on "Save / Load", then "Save XML", copy/paste the generated XML code in `movies.xml`. You can then `make` to check your solution.

### Run SQL queries

Open a new SQL editor and run some SQL queries to anwer to following question:

How many rows does each table contain?
