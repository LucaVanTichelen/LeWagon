During this first week, we will tackle the following challenges:

- Writing code with Python: variables, conditions, loops, list, dict, etc.
- Data collection: gather the data from different sources (CSV, API, Scraping)
- SQL: a lot can already be achieved at the database level, before relying on Python to sort data. Let's dive into some advanced queries!
