Once positioned in the proper folder (see steps above), launch the following command in your Terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook Recap.ipynb
```

It will automatically open your web browser. This is where you are going to code!

Wait for your classmates to be ready and your teacher to give you instructions, don't start coding yet!
